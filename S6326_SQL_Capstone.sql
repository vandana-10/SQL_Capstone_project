-- Business Questions To Answer:

-- Q1-- What is the count of distinct cities in the dataset?
SELECT COUNT(distinct(City)) AS distinct_cities  -- Distinct function helps to retreive all unique values from table 
FROM amazon_sql;                                 -- Count function gives count of values 


-- Q2-- For each branch, what is the corresponding city?
SELECT  Branch,City FROM amazon_sql
GROUP BY  branch,city;


-- Q3--What is the count of distinct product lines in the dataset?
SELECT  COUNT(distinct(productline)) AS distinct_products 
FROM amazon_sql;



-- Q4--.Which payment method occurs most frequently?
SELECT payment,COUNT(Payment)  AS Frequent_method FROM amazon_sql

-- Q5--Which product line has the highest sales?
SELECT  productline,COUNT(invoiceid) AS high_sales_made FROM amazon_sql

 here  Invoice ID represents no of orders been placed by unique identifier each transaction.
 so,i think more invoice id 's gives more orders of product line and more sales increased of products 
and it also Helps track and manage sales records.
here in output we can see fashion accessories has more invoice id's which means more orders are placed on fashion accessories
